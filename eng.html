            <div class="info">My name is Denis, I am 17 years old. I live in Kherson. Novice Front-end programmer. At the moment, I am studying at the beetroot academy, and I am working hard on myself in order to work in the company as a Junior Front-end developer in the future, and to further develop in this industry. Even though I have a little experience, I am always ready to learn something new. I am ready to work in a team and show initiative. I can easily communicate with strangers. Adapted to self-study. I am fond of outdoor activities, playing the guitar and reading popular science literature. In my free time I study English.</div>
